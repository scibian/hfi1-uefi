 terms and conditions. By loading or using the Software, you agree to the terms
 of this Agreement. If you do not wish to so agree, do not install or use the
 Software.
 .
 COPYRIGHT LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Intel grants to You
 a nonexclusive, nontransferable, worldwide, fully paid-up license under Intel's
 copyrights to:
 .
 -	Use and copy Software internally for Your own development and
 maintenance purposes; and
 -	copy and distribute Software, in object code form only, to Your

 under a license agreement with terms at least as restrictive as those contained

 -	copy and distribute the end-user documentation which may accompany the
 Software, but only in association with the Software.
 .
 PATENT LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Intel grants You a
 non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide patent license under Licensed Patent
 Claims to make copies of and use the Software solely for the reproduction or
 use of the Software authorized under the Copyright License. .Licensed Patent
 Claims" means the claims of Intel's patents that are necessarily and directly
 infringed by licensed reproduction or use of the Software that is authorized
 under the Copyright License.  Licensed Patent Claims are only those claims

 GRANTED TO ANY OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, BY ESTOPPEL OR OTHERWISE.
 .
 The Software is protected by the intellectual property laws of the United
 States and other countries, and international treaty provisions. An essential
 basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that no licenses or other rights,
 including but not limited to patent and copyright licenses or rights, are
 granted to You by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses
 expressly granted in the preceding paragraphs.
 .
 You agree that the consideration provided under this Agreement only covers the
 licenses expressly granted to You in the preceding paragraphs, that any other
 rights, including but not limited to additional patent rights, would require an
 additional license and additional consideration, and that nothing in this
 Agreement requires or will be treated to require Intel to grant any such
 additional license.
 .
 You acknowledge that there are significant uses of the Software in its
 original, unmodified and uncombined, form.  The consideration for the license
 in this Agreement reflects Intel.s continuing right to assert patent claims
 against any modifications or derivative works (including, without limitation,
 error corrections and bug fixes) of, or combinations with, the Software that
 are made by You or third parties that infringe any Intel patent claim that is
 not a Licensed Patent Claim.
 .
 If You are not the final manufacturer or vendor of a computer system or
 software program incorporating the Software, then You may transfer a copy of
 the Software  (and related end-user documentation) to Your recipient for use in
 accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided such recipient agrees to
 be fully bound by the terms hereof. You shall not otherwise assign, sublicense,
 lease, or in any other way transfer or disclose Software to any third party.
 You shall not reverse- compile, disassemble or otherwise reverse-engineer the
 Software.
 .
 You may not subject the Software, in whole or in part, to any license
 obligations of Open Source Software including without limitation combining or
 distributing the Software with Open Source Software in a manner that subjects
 the Software or any portion of the Software provided by Intel hereunder to any
 license obligations of such Open Source Software. "Open Source Software" means
 any software that requires as a condition of use, modification and/or
 distribution of such software that such software or other software incorporated
 into, derived from or distributed with such software (a) be disclosed or
 distributed in source code form; or (b) be licensed by the user to third
 parties for the purpose of making and/or distributing derivative works; or (c)
 be redistributable at no charge. Open Source Software includes, without
 limitation, software licensed or distributed under any of the following
 licenses or distribution models, or licenses or distribution models
 substantially similar to any of the following: (a) GNU.s General Public License
 (GPL) or Lesser/Library GPL (LGPL), (b) the Artistic License (e.g., PERL), (c)
 the Mozilla Public License, (d) the Netscape Public License, (e) the Sun

 perform it publicly or distribute any product thereof. You may not use the
 Software or any information relating to the Software except for the purposes
 stated above. You may only disclose the Software available to Your employees
 whose duties require such access and who are obligated to maintain the Software

 rightfully available to the public other than by breach of this Agreement by
 You; (ii) rightfully received by You from a third party without breach of a
 duty to Intel; (iii) independently developed by Your employees without access
 to the Software; or (iv) rightfully known to You prior to first receipt from
 Intel. You acknowledge and agree that if You breach these Confidentiality
 provisions, Intel will suffer irreparable harm for which money damages will not
 be an adequate remedy.  You therefore agree that Intel will be entitled to an
 injunction restraining any breach or threatened breach of these Confidentiality
 provisions without the necessity of proving irreparable harm or posting a bond,
 in addition to all other rights and remedies at law, in equity and under this
 Agreement. If You wish to have a third party consultant or subcontractor
 ("Contractor") perform work on Your behalf which involves access to or use of
 Software, You shall obtain a written confidentiality agreement from the
 Contractor which contains terms and obligations with respect to access to or
 use of Software no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement and
 excluding any distribution rights, and use for any other purpose. Otherwise,

 Name in any publications, advertisements, or other announcements without
 Intel's prior written consent. You do not have any rights to use any Intel
 trademarks or logos.

 representative. You agree to be solely responsible to Your End Users for any
 update or support obligation or other liability which may arise from the

 INTERRUPTION, OR LOST INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
 USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE
 LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY
 FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THE SOFTWARE LICENSED HEREUNDER IS NOT

 SYSTEMS, TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, NUCLEAR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER MISSION

 PARTIES HARMLESS AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, COSTS, DAMAGES, AND EXPENSES, AND
 REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES ARISING OUT OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE
 DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOFTWARE AND ANY CLAIM OF PRODUCT LIABILITY, PERSONAL
 INJURY OR DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH ANY UNINTENDED USE, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIM ALLEGES
 THAT AN INTEL PARTY WAS NEGLIGENT REGARDING THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE
